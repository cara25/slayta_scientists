    "abstract: _According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths [1]. In turn, strokes are the leading cause of death in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2]. We developed — logistic models in order to predict stroke likelihood within patients in hopes to create a model that can be used as a preemptive measure to ensure awareness of stroke likelihood. We hope that our model will supplement current lab-based techniques to benefit doctors, medical providers, and at-risk patients_.\n",

    "In the United States, someone will have a stroke every 40 seconds [2]. The urgency for better stroke protocol and understanding of what causes strokes is pressing because of its prominence in our society. Stroke-related costs in the United States came to 53 billion dollars from 2017 to 2018 [2]. One of the best ways to prevent a stroke is preemptive measures such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle through exercise, abstaining from smoking, and managing underlying health issues such as diabetes [3]. High cholesterol and high blood pressure are early indicators of stroke detection for those more susceptible to stroke [3]. According to the American Heart Association, “Over the past 30 years, stroke incidence among adults 49 and younger has continued to increase in Southern states and the Midwest” [4]. These statistics have motivated our team to create a first step toward preventative stroke modeling through logistic regressions which will predict if a person, given certain characteristics, will be more vulnerable to having a stroke.

    "At-risk patients will benefit the most from our exact modeling because it will allow them to start preventative measures and lifestyle changes sooner to decrease their risk. Along with that, making sure that at-risk patients are prepared is very important to our mission. Helping target at-risk patients with information about how to know if they are experiencing a stroke was very important to us. Taking the next steps promptly is imperative for the person to survive that stroke. Along with that, creating a model that will predict stroke likelihood would also help family and friends of loved ones who are predicted to have a stroke because they could also become more prepared if the situation escalates. Awareness of possible stroke is our driving goal for our patients.\n",
    "\tOur second stakeholder would be a medical professional. Every medical professional swear on the Hippocratic oath and promises to ‘do no harm’ [5]. By having logistic classification models to predict patients' likelihood of stroke, doctors could better address their patients. Along with that, if doctors are unsure of if a person is having a stroke or had a stroke, they can use this model to affirm or reject their null hypothesis. As medical professionals are constantly doing research on different health issues, they can also use this model to find participants in studies of strokes and determine if someone is eligible. \n",
